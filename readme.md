🔐 Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
📘 Overview

This project focuses on understanding and analyzing password strength to improve overall cybersecurity awareness. The goal is to explore how password length, complexity, and randomness affect resistance against common password-cracking techniques such as brute force and dictionary attacks.

By creating multiple passwords and testing them with online tools like PasswordMeter.com
, the project highlights the key factors that determine a secure password and documents best practices for password creation.

🎯 Objectives

1. Understand what makes a password strong.

2. Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.

3. Evaluate each password using online strength testing tools.

4. Record and analyze password strength scores and feedback.

5. Research and summarize common password attack methods.

6. Identify and list best practices for strong password creation.

🧰 Tools Used

a. PasswordMeter.com
 – For evaluating password complexity and scoring.

b. Security.org Password Strength Checker
 – For estimating cracking time.

c. Text Editor (VS Code / Notepad++) – For creating and documenting passwords.

🧪 Step 1: Password Creation
| **Password**              | **Characteristics**           | **Purpose**       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `redteam`                 | Lowercase only                | Very Weak Example |
| `RedTeam123`              | Mixed case + numbers          | Medium Strength   |
| `Red@123`                 | Mixed case + symbol           | Moderate          |
| `R3d@Te@m!2025`           | Mixed case + digits + symbols | Strong            |
| `R3d@Te@m!2025$Secure#AI` | Long + varied symbols         | Very Strong       |

🧮 Step 2: Password Strength Evaluation
| **Password**              | **Score (0–100)** | **Strength** | **Feedback**                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `redteam`                 | 15%               | Very Weak    | Too short, only lowercase       |
| `RedTeam123`              | 45%               | Weak         | Add symbols and increase length |
| `Red@123`                 | 60%               | Medium       | Improve length and randomness   |
| `R3d@Te@m!2025`           | 85%               | Strong       | Balanced complexity             |
| `R3d@Te@m!2025$Secure#AI` | 100%              | Very Strong  | Excellent entropy and length    |

📊 Step 3: Analysis and Observations

1. Passwords with greater length and character diversity achieve higher scores.

2. Randomness and unpredictability significantly increase strength.

3. Short or predictable passwords (e.g., names, words) are highly vulnerable.

4. Each added symbol or character type increases entropy (difficulty to crack).

💡 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

a. Use at least 12–16 characters.

b. Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

c. Avoid personal information (names, dates, etc.).

d. Create unique passwords for every account.

e. Use passphrases (e.g., Blue$Tiger!Jump2025).

f. Store securely in a password manager.

g. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra protection.

🧠 Common Password Attacks
| **Attack Type**         | **Description**                    | **Mitigation**                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Brute Force**         | Tries all possible combinations    | Use long and complex passwords |
| **Dictionary Attack**   | Uses common words and patterns     | Avoid dictionary words         |
| **Phishing**            | Tricks users to reveal credentials | Verify URLs, enable MFA        |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Reuses leaked passwords            | Use unique passwords per site  |

Password Complexity and Security:
Password complexity directly impacts security. Longer and more diverse passwords exponentially increase the time and computing power needed to break them.
For example:

a. Simple password (8 chars): cracked in seconds

b. Complex password (16 chars with symbols): may take centuries to brute force

✅ Conclusion

Through this task, I learned how to evaluate password strength, understand password entropy, and apply security best practices. Testing various passwords revealed that a balance of length, complexity, and randomness is essential for strong security. Password strength evaluation tools are effective in identifying weak areas and improving password creation strategies.
